# Quiet Cool RF Remote with ESPHOME
Operate your remote controlled QuietCool Fan from ESPHome or Arduino.


This project implements an RF remote control system for Quiet Cool fans using an ESP32 microcontroller and CC1101 RF module.
The system can control various fan speeds and modes through RF signals.

## WARNING WARNING WARNING
**This should have been obvious to me before.  Alas, it wasn't.  Each RF remote has a unique ID built-in, and this code literally
only works with my remote for that reason.  Currently, getting this working will take some effort decoding your individual remote. 
Lame, I know.  Whatcha gonna do?

# TL;DR -- get it running on ESPHome
Get a generateic CC1101 board.  Like this [CC1101 Board](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3W9GVRQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)

Make these connections from your ESP32 to your CC1101 chip/board.

NOTE: the pinouts on these boards seem to be not reliable.  I had to trace them manually to figure out which header pin went to which CC1101 pin.  

| Module Pin | CC1101 Pin Name | CC1101 Pin #| ESP32 Pin |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1          | GND             | 16,19,PAD   | GND       |
| 2          | VCC             | -           | 3.3V      |
| 3          | GDO0            | 6           | GPIO13    |
| 4          | CSn             | 7           | GPIO15    |
| 5          | SCK             | 1           | GPIO18    |
| 6          | MOSI            | 20          | GPIO23    |
| 7          | MISO            | 2           | GPIO19    |
| 8          | GDO2            | 3           | GPIO12    |


## TL;DR -- get it running on ESPHome from ESPHome Builder on HomeAssistant

* Go to ESPHome Builder
* Click "+ NEW DEVICE" at the bottom of the screen
* Click `CONTINUE`
* name your fan
* click the ESP32 type you have.
* click `SKIP`
* on your new entry, click `EDIT`
* add the following to the bottom of the file:
```yaml
spi:
  clk_pin: 18
  mosi_pin: 23
  miso_pin: 19

external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/ccrome/quiet-cool-rf-remote.git
      ref: main
    components: [ quiet_cool ]

fan:
  - platform: quiet_cool
    name: QuietCool fan
    cs_pin: 15
    gdo0_pin: 13
    gdo2_pin: 12
    remote_id: [0x2D, 0xD4, 0x06, 0xCB, 0x00, 0xF7, 0xF2]
# optional variables
#    center_freq_mhz: 433.897
#    deviation_khz: 10
```
* click `INSTALL` and install it in the normal ESPHome ways...

## TL;DR -- get it running on ESPHome, building locally

Create a `secrets.yaml` file
```yaml
wifi_ssid: <ssid>
wifi_password: <wifi password>
api_enctryption_key: <api key>
ota_password: <ota password>
```


compile, upload, and run
```
esphome compile quietcool-fan-example.yaml && \
esphome upload --device /dev/ttyUSB0 quietcool-fan-example.yaml  && \
esphome logs --device /dev/ttyUSB0 quietcool-fan-example.yaml
```

If everything is working, you should see
```

[16:48:24][I][quietcool:174]: Starting CC1101 setup

# Configuration

## Required Configuration

The `remote_id` field is **required** and must match your specific QuietCool remote. This is a 7-byte identifier that uniquely identifies your remote control.

> **Note:** QuietCool fans can pair with multiple remotes. This means you may not need to decode your existing remote's ID. Instead, you can simply pair this new ESPHome-based remote (with its own `remote_id`) to your fan, and both your original remote and the Home Assistant remote should work together.  This has yet to be tested.


### Finding Your Remote ID

NOTE:  you may not need to decode your existing remote's ID.  Instead, you can simply pair this new ESPHome-based remote (with its own `remote_id`) to your fan, and both your original remote and the Home Assistant remote should work together.  This has yet to be tested.

To find your remote ID, you can:
1. Use an RTL-SDR to capture signals from your physical remote
2. Analyze the captured signals to extract the remote ID
3. Or use the default value as a starting point: `[0x2D, 0xD4, 0x06, 0xCB, 0x00, 0xF7, 0xF2]`

### Example Configuration

```yaml
fan:
  - platform: quiet_cool
    name: QuietCool fan
    cs_pin: 15
    gdo0_pin: 13
    gdo2_pin: 12
    remote_id: [0x2D, 0xD4, 0x06, 0xCB, 0x00, 0xF7, 0xF2]
    # Optional:
    # center_freq_mhz: 433.897
    # deviation_khz: 10
```

  mosi_pin: 23
  miso_pin: 19
```

## Recent Improvements

### Technical Changes
- Replaced string-based command system with byte arrays for better performance
- Consolidated `logBits` and `sendBitsFromBytes` functions to use shared logic
- Added configurable `remote_id` parameter throughout the stack
- Improved error handling and validation

# Run it on arduino

```
cd arduino
platformio run --target upload
```

# Reverse Engineering
I used an RTL-SDR.COM SDR like this:
![RTL-SDR v3](images/rtl-sdrv3-500.jpg)

And for software, I used Universal Radio Haacker.  Here's a recording of all the signals as they progress from H 1 2 4 8 12 ON OFF -> to medium -> low.  It was recorded with these settings

![Settings](images/record-settings.png)

[Download the raw recording](recordings/RTL-SDR-20250510_080358-433_92MHz-1MSps-1MHz.complex16s.gz)

![Here's the signal demodulated](images/urh-demodulated.png)

![Spectrum Analysis](images/spectrum.png)

## Modulation
This remote uses FSK modulation at 433.92MHz.  The CC1101 RF module ended up transmitting high, so I reduced the frequency in the code to 433.897 to make it work.  If things don't work, check the actual frequency.


## Configuration

The system operates at 433.897 MHz and uses FSK modulation. The CC1101 module is configured for:
- Direct mode transmission
- No packet handling
- Raw data mode
- No CRC or preamble

## Building and Uploading

```pio run --target upload```

# TODO
* Implement the timers in the esphome UI
